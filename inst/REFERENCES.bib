                  research. To provide standardized affective norms for words
                  in Hebrew, we created a database of emotional norms for
                  words, e-millim, which is the first database of affective
                  norms for words in Hebrew. This study establishes the
                  emotional valence and arousal ratings of 1,040 words. Norms
                  were based on ratings by native Hebrew speakers using the
                  Self-Assessment Manikin scale.",
